## Hey there 👋, 

I'm [David Nguyen!](https://github.com/hoangsvit/), founder of [ePlus.DEV](https://eplus.dev)

I am deeply passionate about solving problems and applying first-principle thinking, always propelled by a strong sense of purpose and an insatiable appetite for tackling challenges. My expertise lies in various technologies, including PHP, Javascript, Nodejs, MongoDB, React, Nextjs, AWS, and more.
I am an intrepid explorer of new technologies, a fervent learner, and a born problem-solver. When I'm not immersed in code, you'll often find me engrossed in tech-related YouTube videos, constantly fueling my insatiable curiosity.

Please don't hesitate to connect with me at @hoangsvit to discuss all things tech or to exchange greetings! Let's work together to shape the future of technology. 🌟
